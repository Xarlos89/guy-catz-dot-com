He knows his job and every part of the body so well. He's patient and he listens. Just wonderful. I arrived at the rehab hospital unable to walk or get out of bed, stiff as a board. I was scared. He was the one who got me moving and gave me hope. I said, “Guy, I want to walk out of the hospital”, he looked at me and said “I'm going to get you there”. I told him all of my goals and he actually got me to achieve each and every one of them. I can't be more thankful.`,

    text: `Dr. Guy is realms above any PT I have experienced. His expertise, compassion and natural healing ability made such a life-changing impact on me during my treatments. The healing experience I had through him was so profound I shared it with my meditation group. I came into the clinic for my right shoulder, and simply mentioned to him that I had a severe headache. Instead of ignoring it and only focusing on my shoulder, what is covered by insurance, like most PTs would — he told me to close my eyes, he placed his hands on my neck and head, and I could feel he was channeling healing energy. My pain was fading away. I opened my eyes to see that his eyes were closed. This is the intention Guy brings to his patients. Many others will be blessed and so grateful to have experienced his loving, healing energy, and I have no doubt he will make such a difference in so many people's lives on their road to recovery.`,

/**
 * The Care Hero award.
 *
 * The certificate photograph is now what closes the testimonials — the client
 * asked for it directly, in place of the typeset version that stood here while
 * the file was missing. It is somebody else's artwork on a rainbow ground, so
 * it breaks the page's two-colour rule; that was his call, and it is contained
 * inside one framed photo rather than allowed to spread into the band.
 *
 * The certificate is made of text, so the whole of it is transcribed into an
 * `sr-only` block below the image: without that a screen reader gets a picture
 * and nothing else. The transcript is the certificate verbatim, his own closing
 * quote included, because that quote is on the page the moment the photograph
 * is — this is an equivalent for the image, not an editorial placement of his
 * writing.
 *
 * TODO — needs the practice to fill in: `issuer` is the hospital that gave the
 * award and `period` is when (he said "last year"). Both render only once they
 * are set; nothing is guessed. An employer award is the hospital's to publish,
 * so their sign-off is worth having alongside the patients' before this goes
 * live — more so now that the hospital's own certificate is the artwork.

  closing: `My favorite thing about being a physical therapist is having the ability to not just be of service, but to be a bringer of hope and a source of light for patients enduring very dark times. The best advice I can give is to meet the patients where they're at, and treat them how you would treat your own family member. Meet them with kindness, compassion and a listening ear. Connect. Make sure they feel seen, heard and understood. When you are with them, be WITH them. They should feel safe, comfortable and cared for throughout their plan of care, and know that you are in their corner throughout their healing process.`,
